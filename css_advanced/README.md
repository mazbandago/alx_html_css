# My First HTML and CSS Projects Welcome to my first HTML and CSS projects! This repository showcases my journey into web development, where I have created a series of web pages based on a designer file from Figma. 
## Project Overview These projects are part of my learning process in front-end web development. The goal was to replicate the design provided in Figma as closely as possible using only HTML and CSS. This exercise helped me understand the fundamentals of web design and development, including layout, styling, and responsive design. 
## Features - **Responsive Design**: The web pages are designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes. - **Clean and Organized Code**: The HTML and CSS code is structured and well-commented for easy understanding and maintenance. - **Visual Consistency**: The design elements, such as colors, fonts, and spacing, are consistent with the Figma file to maintain visual harmony. 
## Technologies Used - **HTML5**: For structuring the content of the web pages. - **CSS3**: For styling and layout.

                <h2><strong>ABOUT NADMO, BAWKU SECRETARIAT</strong></h2>
                <p>NADMO in short stands for National Disaster Management Organisation. Its establishment is as 
                   a result of an act of parliatment of the republic of Ghana. Act 927 of 2009 is the current act that
                   binds NADMO. Its main responsibility is to manage disaster. Disaster management cuts across all spheres
                   of life ranging from fire outbreat, floods, windstorms etc.
                </p>
                <h3>DISASTER MANAGEMENT</h3>
                <p>Disasters take many shapes. Human-made disasters result from human errors and include industrial explosions or structure failures. Natural disasters result from physical phenomena and include earthquakes and droughts. Disasters classified as complex can include epidemics or armed conflicts.
                    In whatever form, disasters disrupt communities and can take a serious toll on people, property, economies, and the environment. They often stretch a community's capacity to cope.
                    Disaster management is a process of effectively preparing for and responding to disasters. It involves strategically organizing resources to lessen the harm that disasters cause. It also involves a systematic approach to managing the responsibilities of disaster prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery.
                </p>
                <h4>UNDERSTANDING RISK IN DISASTER MANAGEMENT</h4>
                <p> Often, issues such as a pooly maintained levee system or other negligence can worsen the outcome of 
                    a disaster. Such was the case when Gentiga was overwhelmed in 2010.
                    By addressing deferred infrastructure maintanance and other causal factors, governments and organizations can often prevent, or at least reduce, the fallout of disasters.
